		<p>Well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in the place, and has her photograph
above his fireplace. Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the
window, and I would not have missed the case for worlds.</p>
		<p>Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now. If the cottage is now permanently deserted we
may have some difficulty. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of you
coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up
easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. If you
have reason to believe that is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me. We
shall be with you within an hour of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the
business..</p>
		<p>Shortly after my marriage I had bought a connection in the Paddington district. Old Mr. Farquhar, from whom
I purchased it, had at one time an excellent general practice; but his age, and an affliction of the nature of St.
Vitus's dance from which he suffered, had very much thinned it. The public not unnaturally goes on the
principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of
the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. Thus as my predecessor weakened his practice
declined, until when I purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three hundred
a year. I had confidence, however, in my own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years
the concern would be as flourishing as ever.</p>
